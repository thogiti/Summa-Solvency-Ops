# Zero Knowledge Proofs Security Review: Summa Proof of Solvency Protocol (Version V1)

## Introduction
This document defines the scope of the security audit for the Summa proof of solvency protocol. The audit aims to evaluate the security, reliability, and integrity of the codebase, with a specific focus on zero-knowledge proofs.

## Audit Scope
The scope of this audit includes key areas such as codebase review, protocol flow logic, security features review, zero-knowledge proof implementation, and testing and documentation.

### 1. Codebase Review
- **Repository**: [Summa Solvency on GitHub](https://github.com/summa-dev/summa-solvency/tree/d6e85c9affebef338846d5fb13e40eb8ab657811)
- **Commit Hash**: d6e85c9affebef338846d5fb13e40eb8ab657811 
- **Objective**: Assess the security of the source code, identify vulnerabilities, and ensure best coding practices.
- **Components**:
  - File Structure Analysis
  - Individual File Review
  - Code Quality Assessment

### 2. Protocol Flow Logic
- **Objective**: Understand and evaluate the logical flow of the Summa proof of solvency protocol.
- **Components**:
  - Data Flow Analysis
  - Functionality Mapping
  - Protocol Steps Verification

### 3. Security Features Review
- **Objective**: Analyze the security mechanisms implemented within the protocol.
- **Components**:
  - Authentication and Authorization
  - Cryptography Practices
  - Smart Contract Security

### 4. Zero Knowledge Proof Implementation

## Scope of Files and Folders
### Included in Audit
- `/zk_prover/*`
- `/contracts/src/Summa.sol`
- `/backend/*`
- *Additional relevant files and folders as identified during the audit process.*

### Excluded from Audit
- `/contracts/src/InclusionVerifier.sol`
- `/examples/nova_incremental_verifier.rs` (anything related to nova experiments)
- `/src/circom/*` (anything related to circom)
- *If we find any file[s] not related to this commit hash, then we will add it here.*

## Audit Methodology
The audit can combine automated tools and manual inspection by experts. It can include code review, static and dynamic analysis, and penetration testing.

## Deliverables
The audit report will include:
- Identified findings and vulnerabilities.
- Risk assessment for each finding.
- Mitigation recommendations.
- Summary of the protocol's security posture.

## Duration
The deadline to submit the written review report is [Feb, 28 2024]
