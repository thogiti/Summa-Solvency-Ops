# Bounty Problem 1: Security Analysis of Summa's Proof of Solvency Protocol

## In Draft Mode

## Introduction
Summa, a protocol for proof of solvency, recently transitioned from the conventional Merkle Sum Tree to the Broken Merkle Sum Tree for efficiency reasons, as detailed in [Issue #166 on their GitHub repository](https://github.com/summa-dev/summa-solvency/issues/166). This bounty problem invites the ZK Fellows to conduct a thorough security review of Summa's implementation of the Broken Merkle Sum Tree.

## Objectives
Participants are required to perform an in-depth analysis covering the following aspects:

1. **Threat Model Analysis**:
   - Evaluate the threat model of the Broken Merkle Sum Tree as described in literature.
   - Identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors specific to this model.

2. **Understanding Summa's Implementation**:
   - Provide a detailed explanation of how Summa has implemented the Broken Merkle Sum Tree in their protocol.
   - Assess the adherence of this implementation to the theoretical model and note any deviations.

3. **Mitigation and Vulnerability Analysis**:
   - Analyze how Summa's implementation addresses (or fails to address) the threats identified in the literature concerning the Broken Merkle Sum Tree.
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of any mitigation strategies employed.
   - Discuss if there are any residual risks or vulnerabilities that remain unaddressed in the current implementation.

## Bounty Winner Criteria
The bounty will be awarded to the participant or team that presents the most comprehensive and insightful analysis. The winning submission should:

- Provide a clear and well-structured threat model analysis.
- Offer a thorough explanation of Summa's implementation, highlighting key features and differences from the theoretical model.
- Present a critical and well-reasoned analysis of the mitigation strategies used by Summa, including any remaining vulnerabilities or risks.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submissions should be in the form of a detailed report, not exceeding 10 pages.
- The report should be well-organized, with clear headings and subheadings for each section.
- Include references to literature, source code, and other relevant materials.
- Ensure that all technical terms and concepts are explained clearly and concisely.

## Duration
Participants will have one week from the date of the bounty announcement to submit their reports.

## Evaluation Process
Submissions will be evaluated based on the depth of analysis, clarity of explanation, accuracy in identifying risks, and the quality of the written report. The evaluation will be conducted by a panel of experts from the Summa, PSE team and yAcademy team.
